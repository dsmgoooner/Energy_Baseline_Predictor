# Project Summary for CV

<ol>
 <li>Energy Baseline Prediction and Savings Assessment for an Office Building: Developed a predictive model to establish a baseline for energy consumption using historical data, enabling the evaluation of the impact of Energy Conservation Measures (ECM). The Random Forest model accurately predicted energy usage with an R² score of 0.88, highlighting changes in consumption patterns.</li>
<li>Anomaly Detection and Feature Engineering: Identified 654 periods of unusual energy consumption using Interquartile Range (IQR) analysis, enhancing data quality and model accuracy. Engineered critical features such as Heating and Cooling Degree Days, lagged energy consumption, and peak hour indicators to capture key operational behaviors influencing energy use.</li>
<li>Quantified Energy Savings Post-Improvement: By comparing actual and predicted baseline energy consumption post-ECM implementation, achieved a quantified savings of 2195.66 kWh, demonstrating a 1.65% reduction relative to baseline, validating the effectiveness of implemented energy-saving strategies in line with the organization’s Net Zero objectives.</li>
